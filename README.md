# Binary Decimal Calculator :bowtie:
This is next project which was made on CodersLab bootcamp.
On the page you can see two calculators - binary and decimal. 
Below I will describe how to use it! :boom:

## How to use?
<h5>The first calculator is a binary calculator,
by clicking on the appropriate square with the number its value will change to 0 or 1, 
in this way you can add two numbers to each other :information_desk_person:

<h5>Another calculator is a decimal calculator! Here you have to click on the appropriate square and then ...
enter a value! The value can range from 0 to 9. 
When you enter both numbers that you want to add, just press the plus sign on the left!
<h4> Simple thing, right? :relieved:

## Technologies which I used!
> ECMAScript6, CSS
